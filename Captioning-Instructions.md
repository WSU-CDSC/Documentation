# Captioning Workflow Instructions

### Introduction

These instructions are for the caption creation process for the SHN Vimeo collection. In order to generate subtitles, each video will be initially processed with speech to text software. This output will then be assembled into `.vtt` subtitle files with all content divided into four second segments. While this software does a good job of creating a rough transcript,it is far from perfect, and all `.vtt` files must be proofread and corrected for accuracy. The folowing are the instructions for this proofreading process.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Open spreadsheet

The SHN Transcription Spreadsheet is color coded to the represent status of each video regarding transcripts. Pick one of the files that is marked as `Transcript Generated` (Yellow) and find this file in the `Unedited Transcripts` folder.

#### Step 2: Find file in [SHN Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/sustainableheritage)

The file name of the `.vtt` transcript file will contain the title for the corresponding video in the [SHN Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/sustainableheritage). It will be necessary to have this video open in your browser in order to compare the computer generated transcription against the original audio while you edit the computer generated transcript.

#### Step 3: Open file in text editor

Since the `.vtt` files are just text documents, you can edit them in a standard text editor. Open the transcript in an editor and look at it for any obvious mistakes. As necessary, compare the transcription against the actual video file in Vimeo. Use the timestamps in the transcript to find the relative segments of speech in the video.

#### Step 4: Save file and move to 'Edited Transcripts' folder

Once you are finished editing the transcript, save it as you would a normal text file. Then move it into the `Edited Transcripts` folder.
#### Step 5: Update spreadsheet
In the SHN Transcription Spreadsheet, change the fill color for the transcript you completed to blue to signify that the transcript has been edited and is ready for upload to Vimeo.
