# Captioning Workflow Instructions

### Introduction

These instructions are for the caption creation process for the SHN Vimeo collection. In order to generate subtitles for each SHN video will be initially processed with speech to text software. This output will then be assembled into `.vtt` subtitle files with all content divided into four second segments. While this software does a good job of creating a rough transcript,it is far from perfect, and all `.vtt` files must be proofread and corrected for accuracy. The folowing are the instructions for this proofreading process.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Open spreadsheet

The SHN Transcription Sreadsheet is color coded to the represent status of each video regarding transcripts. Pick one of the files that is marked as `Transcript Generated` (Yellow) and find this file in the `Unedited Transcripts` folder.

#### Step 2: Find file in [SHN Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/sustainableheritage)

The file name of the `.vtt` transcript file will contain the title for the corresponding video in the [SHN Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/sustainableheritage). It will be necessary to have this video open in your browser in order to compare the computer generated transcription against the original audio while you edit the computer generated transcript.

#### Step 3: Open file in text editor

Open the `.vtt` transcript file in a text editor. 
#### Step 4: Save file and move to 'Edited Transcripts' folder
#### Step 5: Update spreadsheet
